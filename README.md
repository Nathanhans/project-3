Python Library library not shown in class:

    geoPandas allowed us to merge geoJson data with other json objects

An overview of the project and its purpose:

    Our goal was to create insightful visualizations for Californiaâ€™s Presidential Election Results over Time, allow the user to glean insights into key trends over time.
 
Instructions on how to use and interact with the project:

    Running the index.html file in Live Server will produce the visualization we built.  The drop down toggle allows the user to switch between election years, and all charts will update to match that year.  Clicking on a county in the choropleth will give the following summary information (County Name, Winning Party, Winning Candidate, Candidate Votes, Candidate % of Total Votes). Hovering on any county in the bar chart will give the following hover info (county name, winning candidate % of total votes).

At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project

    All of our data is aggregated to the county level, which prevents any identification of personal information.  Additionally, we've credited Leaflet and OpenStreetMap in our chloropleth to ensure that credit is given where deserved.
